- There should only be **ONE** shop drawing in the \3. Engineering-Production\* folder at any time. Old copies of the .pdf should be moved into the \Archive of the room folder.
- The Production folder should contain **NO** shop drawings until marked by Stockbiller, at time of release. 
    - Acceptable Submittal Types are, in order:
      > For Submittal

      > For Approval
