# Die Walls Engineering

## Basic Considerations
- 3/4" Plywood, doubled top & bottom plates
- Loose shipping cleat on bottom, 1 3/4" thick (1/16" narrower than die wall width)
- No more than 96" in a run
- 1/2" sheeting either side
- Solid wood studs where brackets are required
- Weight- to be assessed by stockbillers; assess span, countertops, overhang, etc.

## Sizes; unless otherwise specified
- 2x4 size: standard size
- 2x6 size: standard for drains/wet wall
