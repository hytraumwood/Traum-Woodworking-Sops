# Item Balancing

## Solids
  - When "panelizing" solid lumber material, using the same species as backer for balancing is required.

## Veneer
  - All veneer must be balanced with the same *thickness* material
    - This means that if a specialty thickness is ordered for a job, purchasing must be notified to buy backer in the same specialty thickness
  - All pressed panels must have an odd number of parts
  - Grain direction must be the same on both sides
  - Backer should have properties that complement face veneer; comparable shrinkage & expansion rates (specific gravity)
