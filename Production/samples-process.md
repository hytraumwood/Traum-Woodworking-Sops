# Sample Process

## Sample Request
TBD

## Sampling Length/Process
- A standard wood sample blank should be 11" x 96"; a minimum of 7 samples will be cut from each blank, detailed below: 
  1. (1) After any raw treatments have been applied (resaw, wirebrushing, etc.), but before sent to finish room [Mill Copy]
  1. (1) Step sample detailing finish for the finish room
  1. (1) Finished sample for Assembly storyboard
  1. (1) Finished sample for Office storyboard/ sample room
  1. (3) Finished samples for submittal to client
Each of the above samples will receive a label with the project code, date, finish version (i.e. WD-4.2) and space for signature upon approval
- Upon approval from the client, PM to sign the other copies, and distribute to the shop locations determined above.
- Once a job is complete, the samples can be collected for the archive. 

### Notes
- Any solid wood sample must receive the same treatment (7 samples, with one raw for the mill, labeled, distributed).
- Any other material samples (metal, glass, solid surface, etc.) should have the minimum copies necessary for the work done in the shop
  - i.e., if we are assembling and finishing a metal material, assembly and finish need a copy of the sample, as well as the office

## Finish callouts in Innergy
- All shop releases should have a finish callout to MATCH what is input in Innergy
- Innergy's finish codes should match the client's finish codes/schedule whenever possible
- Any change to a finish in shop should come with an amended finish callout to the shop set of drawings in all cases.
- Every work order should have finishes assigned to it in Innergy, wherever possible
