# Item Balancing

## Solids
  - When "panelizing" solid lumber material, using the same species as backer for balancing is required.

## Veneer
  - All veneer must be balanced with the same *thickness* material
    - This means that if a specialty thickness is ordered for a job, purchasing must be notified to buy backer in the same specialty thickness
