# Finish Callouts- Shop Drawings
This SOP is to determine the standard for finish callouts and schedules for shop drawings in all cases

## Finish Schedule
- Each *project* will have a finish schedule of ALL finishes currently approved/sampling for the project
  - Wherever possible, the schedule made by Traum team should match the finishes in the architectural drawings, for clarity; however, priority needs to be made that all drawings released to the shop have a unified schedule internally (i.e., two drawings for the same job cannot both say WD-1 if the finish is different)
- Each drawing will have a finish schedule of the finishes captured in its scope *only*

## Finish Callouts
- Pt. Grade material is to be called out as PT
  - If painted by Traum, finish schedule must say "Paint by Traum"
  - In finish schedule, PT material to be "mill option", for clarity

### Notes
- Please see [Sample Process](/Production/samples-process.md) for finish callouts on shop releases, as well as the process for sampling
