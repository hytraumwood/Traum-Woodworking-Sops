# SOP- Blum Standard Hinge Placement

  **3.5" from bottom of cabinet door, 3.5" from top of cabinet door**

  **Spacing between to be equal**

  **Doors to have two hinges until height of 36" or weight greater than 15lb, three hinges until they reach a height of 62" or weight of 30lb, 4 until height of 84" or weight of 45lb, 5 hinges until height of 96" and weight of 60lb.**

## Exceptions

    - If the hinge interferes with a rollout, shelf, etc. on the interior of the cabinet, move the offending hinge- in this case, all hinge placements to be dimensioned for the shop's legibility/placement 
    - If there is a rollout in the bottom of the cabinet, move the bottom hinge to 4.5" (the others to be evenly spaced) from the bottom of the cabinet door
    - If a sink cab has an apron on the interior, move the top hinge to one inch below the bottom of the apron panel- in this case, a second hinge must be added 2.5" below the top hinge- the rest to be evenly spaced throughout
    - If door width greater than door height- add a second hinge at the top- 2.5" down from the top hinge, and then evenly spaced throughout

Apron panel- Maximum desire by Traum shop to be 6"
