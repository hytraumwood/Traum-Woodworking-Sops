**• 3.5" from bottom of cabinet door**  
**• 3.5" from top of cabinet door**  
**• Intermediate hinges spaced evenly**  

**Hinge Count Guidelines:**

- 2 hinges: up to 36" height or ≤ 15 lb  
- 3 hinges: up to 62" height or ≤ 30 lb

## Exceptions

- If a hinge interferes with a rollout, shelf, or interior component, move the offending hinge. In this case, *all* hinge placements must be dimensioned for shop clarity.
- If there is a rollout at the bottom of the cabinet, move the bottom hinge to **4.5"** from the bottom of the door; others should be evenly spaced.
- If a sink cabinet has an apron on the interior, move the top hinge to **1" below the bottom of the apron panel**. Add a second hinge **2.5" below the top hinge**, then evenly space remaining hinges.
- If **door width exceeds door height**, add a second hinge at the top, placed **2.5" below the top hinge**, and evenly space remaining hinges.
